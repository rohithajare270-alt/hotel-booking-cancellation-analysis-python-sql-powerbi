## Overview
This project analyzes hotel booking data to identify key drivers of cancellations and revenue loss.  
The goal is to help hotels optimize pricing, improve occupancy, and reduce demand uncertainty.

---

## Business Problem
Hotels face high booking cancellations causing:
- Revenue leakage  
- Low room utilization  
- Unreliable demand forecasting  

---

## Dataset
- **118,896 booking records**  
- **32 features**  
- **Hotel Types:** City Hotel & Resort Hotel  
- **Time Period:** Multi-year historical data  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – EDA, feature engineering  
- **SQL** – Aggregations, KPI calculations  
- **Power BI** – Dashboards & insights

## Project Structure

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicates and invalid records  
- Handled missing values  
- Standardized date and numeric fields  
- Created new features (Month, Year, Lead Time Group)  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cancellation distribution analysis  
- City vs Resort comparison  
- ADR trends by season  
- Lead time vs cancellation behavior  

---

## Key Insights
- **37% cancellation rate** represents major revenue risk  
- Long lead time significantly increases cancellation probability  
- City Hotels dominate total cancellations  
- High ADR bookings are more likely to be cancelled  
- Strong seasonal patterns impact bookings and pricing  

---

## Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard provides:
- Cancellation & booking trends  
- Hotel type comparison  
- ADR seasonality analysis  
- Revenue impact KPIs  

---

## Business Recommendations
- Introduce prepayment for long lead-time bookings  
- Offer non-refundable discounted rates  
- Apply dynamic pricing during peak seasons  
- Launch loyalty programs to increase repeat customers
